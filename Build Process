1. Programming language
- a programmer writes source code in programming language

2. Machine language
- a PC understands source code in machine language

3. Build process
- the process of creating executable file from source code

4. Build process in details
a. Preprocessor
- a macro processing program that generates intermediate code
- clean up source code, remove extra lines, remove comments, include the content of header file into the program
- output file format .ii extension(non-executable)

b. compiler
- transforms the code from a higher level programming languange to a lower level programming language 
- there is many options for the compiler, for example GNU compiler collection(GCC)
- GCC is open source and freely availavble to public
- GCC takes .ii file as input and generates the assembly code
- output file format .s extension
- make sure that the written code has followed all the rules of the using programming language(e.g. syntax checking)

c. assembler
- trnaslates the assembly code into machine code
- it takes the assembly code as input and generates the machine code(also known as object code)
- output file format .obj extension in Windows platform
- output file format .o extension in Unix platform

d. linker
- takes the object files generated, link them together, and generates the executable file
- it links the features of all the external libraries(static libraries and dynamic libraries)
- for static library the executable file will contain the static library
- for dynamic librqary the executable file will contain the links to those dynamic libraries
- output the executable files

e. loader
- loads the executable file into the main memory which is the RAM so that the CPU can execute the program
- also loads other libraries which are required by the executable file to run properly

5. Toolchain
- a bundle of all the required build tools
- simply write a command to perform all the build process automatically
- can also perform all these build steps individually

6. GNU toolchain for Windows
a. mingw
- it provides minimialist GNU for Windows

b. cygwin
- it provides Unix-like environment in Windows
